# sethtadd's portfolio website

This is my portfolio website. Tech stack is Sveltekit + TypeScript + ESLint + Prettier. Easy.

I'm working on creating expandable cards/tiles for each of my projects and for my skills and experience that I can add to the site.

## Chatbot

The site is componsed of three columns containing (1) a chatbot, (2) projects I've done, and (3) skills and experience I have.
Each column will be populated with cards/tiles containing info. The reason for this layout is so that the chatbot can interact with and re-organize and emphasize cards/tiles in order to assist users find what they're looking for in a visually helpful manner.
